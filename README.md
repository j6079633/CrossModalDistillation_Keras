# CrossModalDistillation_Keras
This is an implementation of Cross Modal Distillation concept with keras. But not really sure about whether the code has same performance as original one or not.

### Requirements: software
1. Keras
2. tensorflow
3. (option) cuda
4. other python packages: python-opencv

### Files
Dataset: NYU  depth V2 dataset
CNN model: VGG16 

### some reference code
I refer some others code for implementing the CNN visualize part.
But I can't find the website now.
If the code is implemented by you, please contact me.
I will add the reference information.
